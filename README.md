# 📓 Noted

### 📌 Overview
Noted is an intelligent web-based notebook that enables students to write alongside a smart AI-powered assistant. Noted is still in early development and has many exciting plans ahead.

Noted aims to ease any student's experience by giving them more than just another stylus-based note-taking app. By adopting LLMs and other forms of AI/ML to work alongside the student, it aims to boost productivity while still giving the user space to think and work for themselves. Noted also seeks to provide users with a more friendly UX, with simple and easy to comprehend menus, as well as a visually pleasing and dynamic UI.

### Project Purpose

When I first began college, I noticed many students using laptops and drawing tablets to take notes. I wondered, "What if an app could turn those notes into text documents, like Microsoft Word or Google Docs?" Furthermore, "What if those notes could be easily shared with other students in my class or groups?" I looked around online to see if somebody had already made this, and from what I found, an all-in-one app did not exist. I found some that did each function separately, but they usually fell short somehow. So, I took it upon myself to set out and build this application.

### 🎯 Key Features

- ❌ **Cross platform Compatibility:** Noted will be available across multiple platforms such as Mac/Ios, Android, Windows, and Linux.
- ❌ **Intelligent AI assistant:** Marking text, such as underlining, boxing, etc... will activate LLM use.
- ❌ **Social Circles:** Users can join their specified classes and share notes among peers without the need for direct communication.
- ❌ **Flash Cards:** Users can use their created notes to create flash cards and test.
- ❌ **Second Window:** Users can open a pop-up *in-browser* window that allows them to view external powerpoints/websites.
